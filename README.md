This doesn't do anything. But it is a totally functional lightweight development build pipeline for
a React app (using typescript) on Flask.


## Local Development

### Install Dependencies
From root folder:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`npm install`

### Run the App
Also from root folder:

`npm start`

`npm run serve`
